Dear dance enthusiasts, we have again the pleasure to invite you to our next Contact-Improvisation workshop in Berlin! After two very fruitful and enjoyable meetings in Berlin and Leipzig we want to keep on sharing our research around the use of dynamics in contact improvisation. Enjoying the momentum, more than ever!
Jumping around, falling together, lifting and flying each other… once again we will give you the possibility to discover various ways to play with the momentum, using it to feel, enjoy, create and sweat.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Playing with the gravity</h3>
<p>
During this weekend we will learn how to use the gravity force as a dynamic resource in our dance, finding ways to smoothly enter and leave physical contact while dancing together.
</p>

<h3>Moving in three dimensions</h3>
<p>
We aim to bring the participant to a dynamic body and space awareness which allows them to fully sense and spread their movement in three dimensions. This awareness gives us more freedom in our dance… and we can get more and more crazy in our improvisations!
</p>

<h3>Connecting through space</h3>
<p>
We develop an awareness to each others’ bodys which is based on sensing the movement of our gravity center. Through this awareness we become able to feel each others’ intentions in and out of physical contacts. In this frame we can open our dance to the space and become able to enjoy more freedom and more energy in our movements.
</p>
<p>
During the workshop we will discover how lifts can be understood as a smooth weight transfer between two connected centers; that falling can be experienced as a simple change of system; and that weight can be shared without contact, by becoming sensitive to our partner’s intentions. We can then let ourselves fall into fluent level changes, lifts and displacements through space.
</p>
<p>
Once again we are looking forward to share a weekend of playful and dynamic dances with you!
</p>
