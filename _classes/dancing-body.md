  October-December 2019  

  The Dancing Body is a dance class which aims to lay the basis of the connection of body and mind to the dance. We start the class with movement instructions and exercises, that work with the senses in relation to the body parts and inner organs. The exercises bring the attention to what physically happens in the body while we dance or improvise, before the "making decision" stage. This thing will be the base point for an exploration and development of movement and later on for improvisation.  
  As part of the class we will practice working in pairs or in a group to improve the skills of dancing in space with other bodies. We will learn to see the composition created in the space. We will practice touch: how to touch and being touched while dancing, how to respond to different modes of touch. We will learn how to express different qualities of movement in the body, and more. Among this, the class will be corresponding to other fields of art.  
  The class is fit for dancers and for those who want to dance and discover new things in the body, to explore movement, creation, body and mind. Fit also for therapists and for teachers of different body techniques.
