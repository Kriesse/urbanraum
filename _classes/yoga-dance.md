  María is a Dancer, Ex-Gymnast, Actress and Yoga teacher with a strong artistic passion. She followed artistic Gymnastics passionately for ten years competing on high level; concerned abuot her health at a joung age, her parents proposed a more balanced practice and so reluctantly she became an athlete competing in Velocity, Pole and Long Jump. In university she studied Theater Arts, where her big passion for movement and art guided her to Dance and to joining the professional company of Physical Theater and Dance “Rabos de Lagartija”. She later joined the “Dance Intensive Program” at Tanzfabrik Berlin where she trained in Contemporary dance, GaGa, Flying Low, Release, Balley, Improvisation, Movement Research and Instant Composition. At the moment she works in her own projects and teaches yoga, creative writing, and the series of Workshops "The Poetry of the Body - Dance/ActionTheatre/Improvisation"

  As part of her dance training she encountered yoga and started practicing it with her teacher Ana Fernández (Yin-Yang Yoga – Taoist Yoga – Ashtanga Yoga). Immediately she felt connected to the treasure within the practice and philosophy; This built the passion to embrace the practice of Ashtanga Yoga (Sri. K. Pathabi Jois) as part of her life and began the journey of diving deep within. She received her YOGA certification from Yogi Sivadas founder of “Kailash Tribal School”  in Jan. 2016.

  Maria understands yoga as an instrument to free yourself, becoming more open and brave to be able to live lead by the spirit; the dissolvement of tension patterns and being stuck inside leads to a more flexible/open/accesible body wich  further extrapolates into flexible mind and allows the spirit to unfold and rise up, so it can guide you. 


  María encourages her sudents  to meet the potential within and awaken the hidden forces, encountering and going beyond limits. Expanding and opening, uncovering and softening the body in order to meet freedom, emancipation and liberation of ourselves. Honouring our temple, honouring the one who carry´s the soul. Our body.


  Her classes are dynamic and fluid, focusing equally into alightment, precisement, expansion, flow, strenght, flexibility, sensitivity and grace.  You will work in opening the body, guiding attention at will to expand the surface, conecting to our sensitivity, flowing from one posture to another, looking to the places in between.  We will put accurate attention into the change from posture to posture (vinyasa), considering the postures the steps of a choreography we are dancing. 


  Following long sequences we will allow our body to open up, stretching the muscles and tendoms, calming down the system, while keeping ourselves active and ready, moving with the precision of a wild cat that´s ready to hunt, and keeping the inner peace of a whale. The practice considers the Yin and the Yang, the masculine and the feminine energy that we all carry within; allowing the students to experience the guidance of both energies in a non-stop physical journey.  Savasana will serve us in the end, to let the practice affect us.  Influenced by the styles of Ashtanga Vinyasa, Yin-Yang Yoga and her experience in Gymnastics and Dance.
