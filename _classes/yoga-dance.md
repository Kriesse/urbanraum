  /// Special INTO-OFFER for OCTOBER: Try-out: 7 Euro & Yogi Pass: 50  Euro ///  
  
  Dynamic. like a wildcat.  
  Strong. like a deep-rooted tree.  
  Graceful. like a dancer.  

  Are you looking for a Yoga practice? Will you like to expand your body, increase your flexibility (body and mind), sharpen your awareness, embrace a physical practice in your life and find a silent inner place? If this calls you out. Come and try. We start on October the 2nd.  

  ///  
  
  YOGA DANCE is a Vinyasa Flow dynamic class that combines elements of contemporary dance (momentum, grace, flow, and expression), the primary and secondary series of Ashtanga Yoga (such as the asanas and transitions) and the balance of Yin and Yang energies. This class is dynamic and fluid, focusing equally on alignment, precision, expansion, flow, strength, flexibility, sensitivity and grace. We will work on opening the body, guiding the attention and focus to expand the surface, connecting to our sensitivity, flowing from one posture to another, looking for the places in between. We put accurate attention into the change from posture to posture (vinyasa), considering the postures the steps of a choreography we are dancing. Making the body more available and prepared to receive the transformative power of the asanas.  

  Following long sequences we allow our body to open up, stretching the muscles and tendons, calming down the system, while keeping ourselves active and ready, moving with the precision of a wild cat that’s ready to hunt, and keeping the inner peace of a whale. The practice considers the Yin and the Yang, the masculine and the feminine energy that we all carry within; allowing the students to experience the guidance of both energies in a non-stop physical journey. Savasana will serve us in the end, to let the practice affect us. Meditation comes in the end, when the body and the mind are ready to sit, in silence and complete inner and outer stillness. Influenced by the styles of Ashtanga Yoga, Yin-Yang Yoga and my experience in Gymnastics and Contemporary Dance.  

  The class encourages meeting the potential within and awaken the hidden forces, encountering and going beyond limits. Expanding and opening, uncovering and softening the body in order to meet freedom, emancipation and inner liberation. Honoring our temple, honoring the one who carries the soul. Our body.  
  
  María is a dancer, ex-gymnast, actress and yoga teacher with a strong artistic passion. She followed artistic gymnastics passionately for ten years competing on high level. Concerned about her health at a young age, her parents proposed a more balanced practice and reluctantly she became an athlete competing in velocity, pole and long jump. In university she studied Theater Arts, where her big passion for movement and art guided her to dance and to joining the professional company of Physical Theater and Dance “Rabos de Lagartija”. She later joined the “Dance Intensive Program” at Tanzfabrik Berlin where she trained in contemporary dance, GaGa, flying low, release, ballet, improvisation, movement research and instant composition. Currently she works in her own projects and teaches yoga, creative writing, and a series of workshops "The Poetry of the Body - Dance/ActionTheatre/Improvisation"
