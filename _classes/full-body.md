  My main interest is the physical body and it’s various movement possibilities. Through specific physical exercises (strength/coordination/limitations etc.) for each body part we will expand our understanding and knowledge of the potential movement material and widen our movement vocabulary. Starting from a more local, specific and technical layer we will later use this knowledge and experience to translate it in a more global picture of the whole body. We want to get to know the physical body and use it fully as the instrument we were born with. The main tool we will work with is improvisation in which we are aiming for physical complexity, big capacity of coordination, musicality and full body awareness.  
  I want us to work hard but joyfully. I want us to get physical to dance. Since I experience a lot of satisfaction in long term processes I recommend continuous participation.

  Linda Berberich started to follow her interest and passion in dance in Freiburg at TIP – Schule für Tanz, Improvisation und Performance in 2011.  Moving to Berlin Linda began to work closely with Shai Faran from 2013 on. She had the chance to deepen the research with her teacher frequently at the Den Danske Scenekunstskole Kopenhagen and the Iceland University of the Arts Reykjavik as a guest student.
  Moreover she is part of intensive workshops and training with different teachers.  To widen her perspective in the field of movement she started to work with Joseph Bartz since 2016 to build up strength, mobility, balance and other holistic aspects of movement. 
  Next to performing for Judith Sanchez Ruiz she is working together with music collectives and solo musicians to perform in multidisciplinary festivals in Dresden and Berlin. 
  Linda Berberich holds a degree in Cultural Management (BA). She was working in the music industry and the urban gardening movement in Freiburg and Berlin.
