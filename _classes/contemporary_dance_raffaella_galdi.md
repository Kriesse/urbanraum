  Sharing the work with you within the class, I like to bring attention and awareness to:  
  
  - our bone structure, its natural alignment and articulations working more efficiently by using less muscle tension. The purpose is to use muscle for support and realignment of the bones.   
  - the relationship of our body to gravity by aligning the bone structure, respecting its natural condition, we can use the connection with “gravity”, which is natural and always present.   
  - to be in the present moment: bringing awareness to our breathing is the bridge between body and mind. Breathing is natural.  
  
  
  What we will do in class: I will guide with my voice and physical demonstration through a sequence of exercises, using the floor and standing levels, starting very slowly and increasing the speed through out the class process; we will deeply warm up the body. There will be a time frame for movements exploration. I will then teach a dance combination, thanks to which we will specifically work on set movements material.  I like to consider the work as an opportunity for observing, feeling, experiencing, exchanging, confronting and dancing with joy.
