  This class uses guided improvisation, Bartenieff fundamentals, and basic fitness to warm up the body in a way that is accessible to movers from all backgrounds. We will move from a place of zero to a place of everything using all the tools you have collected throughout the class. This class meets you in the place that you are and asks you to take ownership over your own body and movement experience. Come ready to sweat, move, and experiment with new concepts!
