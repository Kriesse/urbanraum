  From 10.09.2019 - 29.10.2019  

  My artistic practice intertwines the energy of movement and the power of image. My focus is to put the body in a constant state of urgency, a "nowness". Presence and energy are fundamental elements of my work, in an attempt to free and open the body to playfully explore different possibilities of dynamic in relation to space and time. The approach to movement and class is intuitive, fresh, dynamic, visceral, imaginative and playful. Starting from the release technique, will begin with an energetic and physical warming up on the floor and we will continue a standing up session, both centralised on the principle of weight, gravity, fall and recovery.  

  We will explore different qualities of movement to energise body and perception. Some work concepts are: fluidity, presence, musicality, endurance, awareness. The aim is to encourage the dancers /performers to find their own poetic movement and to establish a constant observation of the details and accuracy of the movement itself.
