  “From kung fu into dance” is a movement course.   
  In the classes we will engage with movement principles and elements drawn from internal Chinese martial arts. These principles will be our tools for deepening our kinaesthetic body understanding, increasing movement possibilities and learning how this knowledge can lead us into creative movement and dance.
  The classes consist of two main parts: the first part focuses on instructed movements and exercises inspired by martial arts. The second part is taking these principles into guided improvisation, providing a platform for individual research and exploration.

  Themes that will be explored in the course, among others are:  
  - Concept of centre/ core   
  - Body structure   
  - Body connections    
  - Momentum  
  - Transfer of movement and power  
  - Kung Fu way of practice (duration work)  
  - Hard and soft (yin and yang expression)   
  - Partner work
