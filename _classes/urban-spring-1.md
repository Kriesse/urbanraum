  Form.  
  Transform.  
  Perform.  

  The workshop will emphasize on Improvisation and Contemporary Dance technique build-up, welcoming the physical joy of organic movement. The technical part focuses on floor work practice, developing our relation to the floor in all movement levels. But also includes the practice of different movement qualities and dynamics in our dance.

  Through fixed phrases and improvisation tasks, we will study the weight, the flow and direction of movement. We will work on our spacial awareness, both in the space and in the body and develop our kinetics intelligence.

  Important NOTE: The workshop will end up in a performance in Berlin in July 2016 (place & dates to be confirmed). Performing is not obligatory, still the fixed group is of importance. To connect to each other & enjoy dancing together, both in the studio & on stage!
