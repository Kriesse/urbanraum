  The class offers a training in contemporary dance, through which we will gradually prepare our body for moving, working on the release of the tensions in the muscles and on the opening of the joints.

  The main concepts on which we will work are:

  - the support of the floor while you move,
  - the connections between each body parts,
  - the transition between each movement,
  - finding the momentum, through the release and the redirection of each body part, to then be able to connect the movement into the space, creating dynamic.

  In my class principles of “Release Technique” are combined with improvisational tasks that brings you in a constant state of  availability and openness. Everyday our body is different, our sensations through the body are different. For this reason, in the class, much importance is given to the physical listening of the body: we will start from the warming up that allows ourself to connect inside and with the architecture of our specific body, in his tissues, bones and articulations.Then we will collect all those elements ending with a movement phrase.
  We will widen our movement vocabulary enjoying dance.
