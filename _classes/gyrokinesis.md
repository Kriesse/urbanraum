  About GYROKINESIS® Method:  
  “It is a total-body conditioning and balancing system of movement that encourages the spine and joints to stay open and strong. The work stimulates the anatomy’s major organ systems and incorporates special breathing techniques, particular to each group of exercises within the methodology. Fluidity of motion while performing the moves is also a key premise.  

  The system’s unique movement signature is “three-dimensional, using gentle repetitive circling, spiraling and undulating exercises in a set rhythm. Most importantly, an energetic polarity is encouraged by simultaneously reaching in opposite directions, creating both internal balance and support. Through the constant ebb-and-flow and push-and-pull movements, connective tissues are prompted to maintain their suppleness.”  
  Master Trainer Magali Messac
