  Listening to and through the body is a cycle of 5 weekly evening open level sessions suitable for anyone who has the desire and curiosity to get in touch with his/her own body and explore the potential of it’s awareness. 
  Those who have never danced before will learn to move their bodies safely, intuitively and relaxed while professionals, dancers, actors, performers, musicians can deepen their understanding of personal practices.
  
  This module is inspired by my long lasting passion for body awareness. It is based on my movement practice developed over 10 years researching as a contemporary dancer, choreographer and Qi-gong practitioner. The nature of the work provides a continually fresh outlook at each session through softening, observing and inquiring.

  The practice takes you through standing exercises, designed to help you achieve balance, towards a softer and freer exploration of your own movement in relationship to space, the group, silence and sound.
  We will work through an attentive use of the breath, incorporating elements of Qi-gong, using vibration as a tool to relax and open the articulations in order to let the energy flow freely through the body - thus facilitating the letting go of unnecessary tensions held in the body. The specific use of the eyes with visual images will allow playfulness to be part of the process.

  A process of locating joy, softness, openness, presence and stamina into the body!
  Although the 5 sessions are linked drop-in sessions are possible and welcome.
  Wear comfortable and warm clothing with socks or bare feet.
