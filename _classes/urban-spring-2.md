  The workshop is an introduction to the content of Contemporary Dance and of Improvisation. It’s an on-going workshop that emphasizes on technique build-up, welcoming the physical joy of organic movement. We will work on kinetic patterns (vocabulary), as well as on the connectivity within the body, with the space, with others and with the floor. The technical part focuses on floor work practice, understanding the relation to the floor. Understanding the weight, the direction of movement, the flow. Using the flow of the movement to understand the paths followed in space and in the body, we will also explore different movement qualities and dynamics. Working on our spacial awareness, both in the space and in the body, we will develop our kinetics intelligence.

  Step by step, we will meet the Technique and explore all the tools of physical expression, all the way to Improvisation.
