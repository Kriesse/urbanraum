  There will be simultaneously a handstand class for beginner / intermediate level happening as well as an open jam for people that want to come and train together - but don’t necessarily want to follow a class. The space is big enough to do both at the same time and the idea is that we start to create a little handstand community and meet and train together.
  There will be different people holding the space for the jam (Sara, Emily, Dominique,...) and Luka & Mia will give the class, or somebody else if they’re not available.

  And we welcome Urban Sports Club Members M+L  
  You can use any tickets you have previously purchased from Sara before for the class or open training.
