  For dancers, movers and performers who want to increase their practice in the world of movement. 
  This time i will direct the practice in the expanded body as subject for composition with movement. 
  The work will continue focusing in composing instantly with movement, taking awarenes of each movement´s presence in space and time. 
  
  For this process of research i will give special attention to the perception of a multisensorial body that expands and make its surrounding part of itself. The extent here expresses itself through movement, which depends on the way one draws space through perception and imagination. 

  *„The space is not an abstract empty but rather the product of countless concrete moments“." 
  Gordon Matta-Clark.
