  Regulary sessions in Urbanraum start again!

  For dancers, movers and performers who want to increase their practice in the world of movement. This time i will focus the practice on the expanded body as subject for composition with movement. 

  We will base the work also in composing instantly with movement, taking awareness of each movement´s presence in space and time. For this process of research i will give special attention to the perception of a multisensorial body that expands and make its surrounding part of itself. The extent here, expresses itself through movement, which depends on the way one draws space through perception and imagination. 

  *„The space is not an abstract empty but rather the product of countless concrete moments.“* 
  Gordon Matta-Clark.
