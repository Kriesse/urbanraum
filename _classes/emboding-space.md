  Due to the creation process of the Urbanraum coproduction "Damp Sheets/The Expanded Being Project" the sessions on the 20th and 27th of June must be cancelled. The next session will take place on the 4th of July!

  For dancers, movers and performers who want to increase their practice in the world of movement. This time i will focus the practice on the expanded body as subject for composition with movement. 

  We will base the work also in composing instantly with movement, taking awareness of each movement´s presence in space and time. For this process of research i will give special attention to the perception of a multisensorial body that expands and make its surrounding part of itself. The extent here, expresses itself through movement, which depends on the way one draws space through perception and imagination. 

  *„The space is not an abstract empty but rather the product of countless concrete moments.“* 
  Gordon Matta-Clark.
