Every weissmann* class begins with focusing one’s energy with a short yoga sequence. Clear placement, stretch and strengthening exercises warm the pelvis and spine while preparing the body for a more uninhibited experience of movement. The mind begins to permeate the body through concious breathing.
</p>
<p>
The warm-up phase of the class integrates “technical” elements (floorwork, plies, deep curves, adagio) with short phrases of contemporary movement (exploration of muscular release, spatial awarness, risk taking). Its main focus is exploring a balance between one’s technical skills (buliding strength and control) with a capacity to flow and move through space freely.
</p>
<p>
As the class progresses, the dancer begins to make a connection between these two polarities, softening and fusing them into one. Movements that are traditionally “technical” become more organic, full of breath, life  and volume. “Contemporary” movements become infused with more clarity, length and control. Dancers are encouraged to first experience their muscular energy, and then to conciously direct it into space.
</p>
<p>
Particular movement themes such as rhythm and musicality, quick directional and level changes, initiation of movements from specific points in the body (the fingertips, the crown of the head, hip, sternum, etc.), or floorwork will be explored. Dancers will be challenged to take risks, to test boundaries, to cover more space.
</p>
<p>
The class will conclude with a longer choreography that connects all of these elements. One is prepared for an uninhibited range of movement. All spatial levels will be explored: floorwork, taking space on a “middle level”, and airtime: jumps. Here, one can fully explore dynamics, transitions, interpretation and intention… a celebration of our art form and our aliveness!!! Soulful music inspires and accompanies all moments of the class.
