  The course/session is directed to dancers, performers and movers, who are interested on the praxis of improvisation, instant composition and performance.
  Departing from a kinesthetic relationship with the body, we will deepen the connection between our creative being and our body/mind. Our physicality will be the medium to express it through experiencing the instant. We will focus on abilities such as:
  listening in an expanded sense - getting a subtle sense of what we are composing at the present moment -, tuning into others -listening and sending out to fellow performers and to the space - becoming able to lead and follow - getting a sure sense of timing/rhythm/space - understanding of beginnings and endings of phrases - visualizing contexts and dramaturgy in our compositions.
  Our intuition, imagination, our paths of moves in space and time, the resonance of our physical actions become also tools for our practice.
  Inner states and qualities of movement would be also integrated in our performative research.
