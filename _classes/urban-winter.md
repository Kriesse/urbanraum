  The workshop emphasizes on Improvisation and Contemporary Dance technique build-up, while inviting the physical joy of organic movement  and physical expression. The technical part focuses on floor work practice, understanding the relation to the floor, the ways to get in/out, but also to use our everlasting partner: the floor. The approach also focuses on the flow of the movement, understanding the paths of the moving body, exploring different movement qualities and dynamics.

  Improvisation is used in the class, both integrated into fixed material and separately. To wake up our receiving antennas, our tools of movement, of expression and body awareness.

  Improvising our warm up & warming up our Improvisation.
