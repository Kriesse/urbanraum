  URBAN PERFORMANCE SERIES is a performance format at URBANRAUM which started in spring 2019. This new program is a collaboration between dancer and choreographer Annukka Hirvonen and URBANRAUM.  

  Every 2-3 months on Sunday, Berlin based artists will present several short performances (about 20 minutes each). The performances will be staged with minimal technical support, to allow the audience to fully experience their simplicity and rawness. The goal is to provide a new platform for improvisation as the medium and method to actively reflect on different topics through performance. This series is open to artists who work with improvisation and living it on stage as well.  

  URBAN PERFORMANCE SERIES hopes to foster an exchange of impulses and new perspectives between artists and audience.
