  URBAN PERFORMANCE SERIES is a new performance format at URBANRAUM which started in March 2019.  
  This new program is a collaboration between dancers and choreographers Jenny Ocampo, Annukka Hirvonen and URBANRAUM.  

  Every 2-3 months on Sunday, Berlin based artists will present several short performances (about 20 minutes each). The performances will be staged with minimal technical support, to allow the audience to fully experience their simplicity and rawness. The goal is to provide a new platform for improvisation as the medium and method to actively reflect on different topics through performance. This series is open to artists who work with improvisation and living it on stage as well.  

  URBAN PERFORMANCE SERIES hopes to foster an exchange of impulses and new perspectives between artists and audience.  

  A. [Landscapes of the incomprehensible}  
  Silja Tuovinen  
 
  I am living the questions for now. When you died, where did you go? Where can we still meet to smile at each other?  
  Having a sense of a past and moving toward what we assume is death, enjoying the ride. Archiving in order to let live, archiving in order to let go.  
  This is a piece on how to let life get to you. Pulse, genes, stardust, headrush <<<  

  Silja Tuovinen (b. 1995) is a dancer and creator from Northern Finland based in Berlin. Currently her interests lie in dealing with “the beyond” through body and dance. Silja holds a degree in Peace and Conflict Studies and incorporates thought patterns deriving from her education also in her artistic creations.

  I is No Body  
  Reconsidering  
  Body is an I  
  If you want to BE you need an Eye  
  No more eye wide shut  
  Let it all IN  
  As an ocean     
  As One I  
  As many Eyes  
  Open the gate  
  Remember and you will never forget   
  Return again    
  And again   
  You can   
  BE  
  No body   
  Is what I can see  

  The Search through the many that are part of my being, is an inspiration to let the moment unfold through one body. In playfulness and curiosity Through Body-Voice-Sound, I am what the moment wants me to be...  

  AyaM- I’m an independent dance and voice performer, singer songwriter, choreographer, space holder and teacher, based in Berlin. My work is characterized by the encounter between voice sound and movement in performance and healing practises. Since 2013 I’m researching, developing, teaching and creating my own work in This field, and i developed classes and workshops "Attentive Bodies" - Practice for the sonic Body that i teach in Dock11 and Urban Raum.  

  C. Luft-Erde  
  Karina Suarez Bosche  

  She is interested in art and movement as a sensitising and healing human process. This means for her that in order to create, a consciousness of social-political reality is needed to produce art that can expand awareness in society. In her performative work, she is concerned in providing the public an equal footing on its perception, developing new audiences configurations "at eye level".  

  Karina is a Mexican dancer, choreographer, improviser and yoga teacher with German roots. She received a Master´s degree in Choreography at the Hochschulübergreifendes Zentrum Tanz Berlin (2014). Since 2015 she co-direct the Platform PARAR / Immersive Performance Art touring in Taiwan, China, Norway, Mexico and Germany. She teaches worldwide Workshops like: MIRAR Laboratory, Presence and Improvisation through Somatic Principles and Creative Movement through Yoga.  

  D.  Grey  
  Susanna Ylikoski  

  This work is an on-going research of what is the state of being grey. It is unfinished, untamed and doesn’t have a place yet.  

  Susanna Ylikoski (FI) is a dance artist who recently came to Berlin. She started with improvisation and later studied in Salzburg Experimental Academy of Dance, SEAD, to deepen her technical understanding in the mechanics of the body. Recently, she has started to create her own work. She is interested in subtleties and that which often goes un-noticed.
