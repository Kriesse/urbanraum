  ‘The Line That Fools’  
  by Charlotte Pauwelyn  

  A collision.  
  A body lying on the ground, an effect of gravitation.  
  What was the cause that made me fall?  
  I get up.  
  I stand in the middle.  
  Do I?  
  What's the reference?  
  I want to move on, I make a choice, at least I call it a choice.  
  The way I go isn't as linear as I tent to make it. Some frame must make me move this way.  
  I dream away, a vague realisation there could be more to it. If only I could change the roles and move that frame...  
  Because - because of - despite - thanks to?

  } Wander {  
  by Natsuko Tezuka
  Even the next room can not be found Unstable days  
  Walking in an empty plain  
  I have the feeling I have to hurry up for something  
  Walking, walking, walking, there is no destination  
  On each place I can see the lives of various people  
  No hidden foolishness, conflict, funny behavior, mercy, restful moments, dreams  
  The feeling drifts up, an alluring and life-like life  
  Let's dive in to that forest and make my own step with stray  
  Continue, continue and continue  

  I live in Berlin since just a few months. People in Berlin do not get tired of seeing it. Everyone lives a life-size life in their honesty while struggling. I would like to observe that and try out what kind of waves will happen to me.  

  Dance & choreography: Natsuko Tezuka
