  Im Rahmen des Performing Arts Festival Berlin, 23.-29. Mai 2016 |
  
  A huge porcentaje of dancers and choreographers based in Berlin see themselves forced to apply to the Hartz IV support offered by the German government to cover the basic surviving kit.
  These artists put their hearts in what they do and certainly would prefer to work hard in their field than to depend on this. 
  For HEARTS IV <3 Martha Hincapié Charry will reunite a group of these dancers and choregraphers in the Urbanraum to meet in an intimate an close dialogue with the public, followed by an open air physical encounter where they will make, through movement, a reflection about their bodies and their actual state.
  
  Bodies are not stable entities, neither the world we are living in. HEARTS IV <3 will open spaces for subjective notions about the relationship between self, society and body, looking to assess politics in regards to identity and action, constituting a human community.
  
  By and with: Martha Hincapié Charry – Perferic Berlin/Bogotá, dancers and choreographers based in Berlin.
