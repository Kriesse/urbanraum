  Pareidolie is creating a living organism consisting of various art forms.  
  Intertwining and connecting artistic proposals to one journey that invites an audience to experience, observe and participate.  

  PERSPECTIVE II : EMPTINESS   
  Is a dive into the unknown,  
  an open laboratory,  
  an improvisation,  
  coming from emptiness,   
  leading us into emptiness   
  and escaping emptiness.  

  Spend your Saturday afternoon in the vast universe of emptiness, between 1 - 5 pm you're free to explore, engage, hang out and have a drink!  

  The constellation of creators is meeting for the first time.   
  Each one is bringing their own craft to share their unique perspective.  

  YOU ARE INVITED TO JOIN THE RESEARCH already.  
  Share your own perspective by posting pictures, videos, texts in the event to what emptiness means to you!
