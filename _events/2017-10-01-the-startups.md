  Come and join these three young artists on this evening of sharing of new works in progress!  
  Doors open at 7.30pm!  

  I  
  RACHELL BO CLARK: If You Can Imagine It, It’s Possible  
  This work reflects my research into the human desire for progression and its inherent link to the departure from humanness’. Throughout my research I have begun to focus on the relevance/ irrelevance of the physical body and the pleasures as well as the perils related to the current state of human connection to the other, space and the self.  

  II  
  JOS McKAIN:  
  This yet untitled work excavates images of maleness from media meditations that encompass violence, sexuality and authority. It look to narratives of a culture that visually codes privilege into the white male body. Focusing on fluctuations balance between the irl & url*, it asks how this fracture might apply to systems of fear, guilt, grief, rage, and love.  

  III  
  MACIEK SADO: Northing: diffracted (work-in-progress, title-in-work)  
  Space-time Coordinates for Northing: diffracted: Ghostly appearances of subjects/ diffracted by liquid identities/ diffracted by handmade augmented reality/ diffracted by nostalgia for the lost futures/ diffracted by nothingness and around zero field fluctuations/ diffracted by post post-internet multitasking bodily activities/ diffracted by childhood memories/ diffracted by 2017/ diffracted by just past/diffracted by not yet.

  III  
  MACIEJ holds a Bachelor in Choreography from SNDO (School for New Dance Development) and Master in Medicine from Medical University in Wrocław. Based loyal to his practice in between Amsterdam, Berlin and Wrocław. His research is focused on the notion of Nothingness, The Void and The Virtual as an integral part of moldable, a in-constant-becoming reality. Following Karen Barad’s concept of Agential Realism he is interested in creating theatrical phenomenas - rather than performances - on the verge of theatre, dance and body related practices. A phenomena where subjects are not produced in order to give meanings but come into being by practices of oblique perspectives. His works were shown in festivals around Europe (The Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Spain).
