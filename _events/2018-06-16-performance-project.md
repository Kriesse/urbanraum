  1. OR NOT  
  Contemporary dance & Improvisation, Performance Project 2018 Showing, by Iliana Kalapotharakou  

  Six people are exposed to the relations created between them. They are affected from each other, they make choices for themselves, they affect each other. They are alone and they are together. They come together and they separate. They collaborate, they celebrate, they disagree, they work things out. Or not. They are all together. They are all alone.  

  Six people dare to connect to each other. They dare to get exposed.
  They dare to invest on each other, to trust each other. Or not.  
  They dare to listen to each other, to understand each other. Or not.  
  They dare to BE with each other, to share with each other. Or not.  
  They dare to let each other down. Or not.  
  They dare to be in RELATION to each other.  
  They are all together.  
  They are all alone.  

  Performers:  
  Cristina Genova, Zoe Kourkouraidou, Noora Oertel, Kathrin Oerters, Anastasia Simaioforidi, Melody Stowe.

  3. PURE IMPROVISATION PERFORMANCE  

  We are celebrating Improvisation! The “Pure Improvisation” performance is an open improvisation space with LIVE MUSIC, offered to professional dancers and performance artists of all kinds. Embracing all possibilities and inviting interaction, we offer the circumstance for Improvisation to occur. Both musicians and performers improvise, composing in the moment, but also interacting with each other.  

  THE STRUCTURE:  
  This Improvisation session is structured in small "pieces". In every round, the duration of the piece to be improvised (between 2 and 8 minutes) AND the number of performers (between 2 and 6) is given by lottery!
  Only rule: It's NOT possible to perform twice in a row!  

  Duration: 35-40 min  

  IMPORTANT NOTE:  
  For performers interested, they can order a VIDEO making, focused on themselves, from the cinematographer of the weekend for their own professional use.  

  REGISTRATION:  
  Please subscribe by email (lynnkalapotharakou@gmail.com) if you want to take part to the Pure Improvisation performance, describing with a few words yourself artistically and indicating the date(s) during which you want to perform.
  Participants can be professional dancers and performance artists of all kinds.  
  We are looking forward to your registrations!!
