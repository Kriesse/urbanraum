  *STILL LIFE*  

  Concept, direction and dance: Irene Cortina González  
  Music: Paul Dill  
  Costumes: Christin Noel  
  Duration: 15min  

  “Still life” enjoys studying the relationship of its elements in the scenic composition and uses space, time and distance as tools of creation. This proposal invites contemplation as a means to reach a state of flux, feeding the cognitive plane through the sensory. The piece is the deconstruction of a still life. Through the subtraction of elements and the addition of factors that potentially undo it's conceptual structure, the choreographer creates a very plastic and dynamic proposal.

  *AUGURY*
  
  Choreography and performance: Andrea Krohn  
  Music: Henrique Iwao  
  Duration: 20 Min  

  The piece exposes the fear of violence to which we are constantly subjected and which formats our bodies and actions establishing diverse paranoias: don’t walk alone in a dark street, don’t trust a stranger, don’t touch abandoned bags in public spaces… The experience of living in a big metropolis like São Paulo finds expression and echo in Berlin, where the dance becomes concrete: urban spaces, train stations, open squares. As the performer intervenes and dialogues with the surrounding architecture, acknowledging spaces of fight or flight, they become stages of confrontation with one another and with oneself.

  *UNKN_OWN BODY*
  
  Choreography and performer: Karina Suárez Bosche  
  Duration: 15 minutes  
  With kindly support of: Lake Studios  

  "Unkn_own Body" is a solo work that questions the acceptance of the existence. Idea related to a being, who is not yet a “somebody” or a “someone” and suddenly it enters into this world. It doesn't know what it is, who it is, where it is or how to react. It is an asexual body. The piece tries to capture the essence of a being related to the simple presence of a body as a way of existence. A body that has all its components already to live, to breathe and to ask for all its needs, but at the same time a body that is unknown to itself. The only possible reactions are erratic and illogical. The connection to the world through the action of crying becomes an important factor that affects this unknown body. The crying is a declaration of disorientation but at the same time it is the only way to communicate something with the outside world.
