  An Evening of Instant Composition with    

  Andrew Wass, Jonas Wentritt & Simon Rose   
  Ula Corn & Noriko Okamoto  
  Collective ONE:THIRD  

  Imprevu# is a platform for dancers, performers, musicians and visual artists to present their work in live improvisation and instant composition publicly.  

  Instant Composition is a creation in the present moment, as an ephemeral structure, emerging from the improvisation: following what is there, falling in the unknown, making choices, playing with space and time...Itâ€™s a living piece, where performer and watcher can be surprised and challenged!  

  Price: Sliding scale 5-12 Euro  

  We are happy to announce that Imprevu# 15 will be hosted in Urbanraum. http://urbanraum.com/  
  The venue has wheelchair access, please write to info@urbanraum.com beforehand.  

  More information about the evening program coming soon:
