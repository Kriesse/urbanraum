  Premiere: July 2017  


  Damp Sheets is part of an ongoing project Expanded Being, where choreographer Jennifer Ocampo explores the relationship between choreography and architecture. In it, she investigates about new spaces between the body and places, emotions and house`s edges, allowing a certain instability to appear in the relationship to objects, to materials and walls. A sublime sphere is inhabited by the performers, unfolding layers of memories and history.  


  „We need walls like damp sheets which lose their shapes and wed our fears…to find those umbilical cords that put us in communication with other suns, objects of total freedom that would be like psychoanalytic mirrors.“ Roberto Matta
