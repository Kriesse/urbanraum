  A space of research for urban people to move, share and exchange with each other. All dancers, movers, performers and musicians are welcome. The sessions are guided by the choreographer Jennifer Ocampo Monsalve who, together with URBANRAUM, is interested to offer a space to enrich our tools for improvisation, creation and composition.
  All levels are welcome!

  If it’s possible to be on time it would be better for the process of the session but you can jump in as well in case you can’t make it on time.

  If you have further questions about the sessions don’t hesitate to write to the choreographer, Jennifer Ocampo Monsalve.
