bio_de: |
  Born in 1984 in Morelia, Mexico, Karina is a Mexican-German dancer and choreographer. She is interested in art as a living and sensitising human process. This means more precisely for her, that in order to create, a consciousness of social-political reality is needed to generate work that can expand awareness into society. Dance for her is a physical and emotional body-mind presence that has the power to connect with the world in various dimensions. In her performative work, she is concerned in providing the audience more challenges, proposing several times new configurations of the public.
