bio_de: |
  Currently I'm based in Berlin and working on several projects as dancer and choreographer, beside my commitment as dance teacher, I’m also teaching GYROKINESIS® method.
  In 1993 I graduated in Ballet and Modern dance in Italy. Till 2002 I kept increasing my knowledge with teachers such as D. Zambrano, I. Wolfe, C. Carlson and S. Linke.
  In 2004 I was involved in the new production "Macht das Was?" created by Susanne Linke for Versiliadanza company. From 2005 to 2007 I took part of the evening Solos choreographed by
us, as company's dancers, and coached by S. Linke.
  I worked in several dance companies, but since 1999 I've been involved as dancer, choreographer and now as guest in the "BorderLine Danza" contemporary dance company.
  Starting from 2006 I've been collaborating with Luca Canciello (musician and composer) creating "Stepstuned", a project focused on the research of interaction between noise/sound
and movement.  

I also worked and working at Deutsche Oper and Staatsoper Im Schiller Theater for several projects. Next to my dance activity as choreographer and dancer, I constantly teach contemporary
technique, composition and improvissation. Since 2013 I’ve been working with S. Linke as assistant and interpreter during her workshops
across Europe. With my projects, coached by her, I performed in several Festivals(100grad Berlin,Tanznacht Berlin, Die Lange Nacht der Opern und Theater, 638 Kilo Tanz Festival ).
Since April 2015 I've been involved, together with other colleagues, in the "Inner Suspension" project, which is the S. Linke's technique. This education-project will give me the possibility to
get a certification and be authorized to teach the Inner Suspension technique.
