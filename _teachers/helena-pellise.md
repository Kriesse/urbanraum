bio_en: |
  HELENA PELLISÉ is a dancer, improviser, teacher and meditation practitioner.
  Trained in contemporary dance in Barcelona and specialized in improvisation in Israel with AECID Grant (07-08). Since then she is deeply committed in this discipline as the basis of her body and movement work.
  She continues expanding her studies with masters such as Lisa Nelson, Steve Paxton, Julyen Hamilton, Scott Smith, Mal Pelo Co., Steve Clorfeine, among others. She begins practicing and studying meditation in 2010 in the Shambhala tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. This event clearly marks a before and after in her understanding of her practice of dance improvisation, since then incorporating a contemplative approach.
  She teaches workshops and performs nationally and internationally.
