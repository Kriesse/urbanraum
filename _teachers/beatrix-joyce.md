bio_en: |

  Beatrix Joyce is a performance artist and dance writer based in Berlin.  
  She trained in contemporary dance at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London and furthered her movement practice with yoga and capoeira.  
  In the search for new sources of inspiration for her artistic work, she undertook an MA in Critical & Creative Analysis across the departments of Sociology, Music and English Literature at Goldsmiths University, London. 
  For her dissertation she invented an empirical research method informed by her background in performance. She is interested in bringing theory into practice and using performance and improvisation as a means to connect, share and discover.
