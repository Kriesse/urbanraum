Today’s world needs art to heal our bodies from our souls. Art as a tool of transformation. From our inner feeling and sensations. From our inner beast, being present. With a conscience practice. (Is not easy - for sure is fun). Then, there is not past to regret of, there is not present to be disappointed and not future to be worry about. Just moments of learning, moments of understanding our own world, our inner beast, and our own life. And so, we can share and maybe get to understand others life.
<br> <p> 
</p> The Workshop invites us to meet our -wild animal being- that naturally follows the path of its physical and emotional actions. The present and future life as Creative Platform.
<br>
These meetings are for all levels and are open to bodies and ideas in different fields. Dancers, performers, workers, engineers, stripers, lovers and … are invited, not movement background required. Is required to have passion to explore the body, the own possibilities, frustrations and the fact of being alive:
<br>
'CUERPO PRESENTE: THE INNER BEAST' aims to help participants in a better process their organic inner sensations - listening and feeling the present moment - present them externally in clear forms, and through tasks, focus their attention in the ‘natural’ character of their movements, authenticity and conscience.  
<br>
With themes, physical tasks, improvisation and research tools for individual and collective movement. Participants are guiding through their own experiences to perceive consciously the vital moment, and integrate their bodies and minds with time and space simultaneously.
<br>
In a complement with the life as a tool of work practice. Next to the body, being a wild - animal in an emotional path.
<br>
This meeting ends with individual or group practices of instant composition, following proposed rules as scenography guidelines training, from the dialogues or agreements established during each sessions. In an instant composition of what we being explore.
