  In Kung Fu Dance we explore movement principles and elements drawn from internal Chinese martial arts. Through these principles, we can deepen our understanding of the kinesthetic body which further increase our awareness of movement possibilities and leads us into creative movement and dance.  

  Yin & Yang:  
  Through the concept of Yin and Yang, we will explore the opposite and complementary qualities and textures in the body and observe the different expressions which manifest.  In the Yin and Yang symbol, one half can't exist without the other.  In the same way, the movement qualities of Yang such as structure, expansion and power are interdependent to the Yin movement qualities which are softness, receiving and releasing. We will learn about the different attributes and how they support and transform each other in order to enrich our movement and presence.  

  The workshop will consist two main parts: the first part will focus on instructed movements and exercises inspired by internal martial arts. The second part will take the principles into guided improvisation, providing a platform for individual research and exploration.  

  Themes that will be explored in the workshop, among others are:  
  - Concept of center/ core  
  - Body structure  
  - Body connections   
  - Spiral movement  
  - Momentum  
  - Transfer of movement and power  
  - Partner work
