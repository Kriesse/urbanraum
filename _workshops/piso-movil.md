  The „Piso Movil“ Training System makes the floor the first material to get in contact with the performer’s body. There, it is where the support relationship with the floor (push and pull) travels to depth the space experience. Thanks to the sense of touch, the floor prepares the performer to come into contact with a second material of less density and mobile: The body of another.  Somebody else’s body prepares the performer to get in contact with the last destination: the air. In the „Improvised Movement Writing“ the body is taken as a surgical instrument of the air and space. We can give intentionality to the action, be aware of the existence of the sonority, and find out how deep the theatrical consequence can be out of it.
