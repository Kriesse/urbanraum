The workshop uses movement, voice, and expressive arts, as creative resources to connect with the stories living inside of us that are waiting to be told. It addresses the inherent wisdom of the body, deepening one's awareness, and transforming one’s nature through performative states.

Her artistic practice also includes performing with Constanza Macras/Dorkypark since 2008, as well as working with visual artists, composers, and designers in durational performances and interactive installations.

She is certified in “Personal Embodiment” at Tamalpa Institute California, learning the Life/Art Process®, an expressive arts and dance therapy method founded by dance pioneer Anna Halprin and her daughter Daria Halprin.
