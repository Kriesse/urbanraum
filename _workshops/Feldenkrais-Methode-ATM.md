  Awareness Through Movement (ATM) consists of verbally directed movement sequences presented primarily to groups.
  
  A lesson generally lasts from forty to sixty minutes. Each lesson is usually organized around a particular function.
  In Awareness Through Movement lessons, people engage in precisely structured movement explorations that involve:
  
  Sensing , feeling, imagining and moving
  
  Many lessons are based on developmental movements and ordinary functional activities. Some are based on more abstract explorations of joint, muscle, and postural relationships.
  The lessons consist of comfortable, easy movements that gradually evolve into movements of greater range and complexity.
  
  Musicians, dancers, and athletes have attained better levels of performance with the help of the Awareness Through Movement method. Although Feldenkrais developed this system working with basic movements such as standing, crawling, walking, running, and breathing, his approach can also be applied to improving the fine movements required to play a string instrument.
  Feldenkrais discovered that our ability to move with speed, precision, and power depends on our sensitivity, or our ability to feel what we are doing. Recent findings by neurophysiologists about how the nervous system organized movement, by changing the bias on the sensing elements in the muscle, confirm Feldenkrais practical work. Thus, by paying attention to the details of small, light, slow movements, instrument players can improve both their sensitivity and their performance.
