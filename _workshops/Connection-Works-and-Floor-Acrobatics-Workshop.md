  The workshop will focus on Improvisation and on the development of connectivity in Contemporary Dance. The principles of floor work practice will be introduced through small phrases. The study of organic movement, connectivity, fluidity and awareness will be practiced throughout our movement tasks, partnering work and improvisation dances. The workshop is made to introduce the main principles to people of less experience and to challenge the Improvisation spaces and partnering skills of more experienced movers.
  
  The main elements to be studied are:  
  - Connectivity. Spacial and body awareness.   Connectivity is studied both in terms of a fully connected moving body and of a mover in a state of full connection with their environment. How the body moves in its full awareness, connecting and interacting with its environment - the other people, the space, the floor- and its own inner state at the same time.
  Spacial and body awareness, together with connectivity practice, helps to develop a unified physical and mental consciousness, thus a moving body in its full consciousness expressing itself in space and time.
  - Connection Works approach:  To achieve effective communication, we need to understand the body and the tools it uses to connect. Starting from our own dancing body, we will take a journey into building connections with others, in order to dance together.
  Togetherness in Dance, as a result of effective communication, requires openness, availability, vulnerability, awareness and listening, together with a body in a state of readiness to act, react, interact. In our workshop journey we will develop the ways and tools of physical connectivity, approaching them through a connected state of mind. We will dance together and allow 'togetherness' to teach us.
  - Floor Work & Floor Acrobatics:  
  The dancer's relation to the floor through all movement levels will be developed, using multiple floor-work patterns and phrases. Using levers and clear pathways, building up a vocabulary that can be used in further understanding the mechanics of movement. Handstands basics, building-strength exercises and different variations of handstands will be practiced. We will work on integrating the floor acrobatics we learn into our dance in and out the floor.
