  **From kung fu into dance** is a movement workshop.  
  In the workshop we will engage with movement principles and elements drawn from internal Chinese martial arts. These principles will be our tools for deepening our kinaesthetic body understanding, increasing movement possibilities and learning how this knowledge can lead us into creative movement and dance.  
  The workshop consists of two main parts: the first part focuses on instructed movements and exercises inspired by martial arts. The second part is taking these principles into guided improvisation, providing a platform for individual research and exploration.  
  The primary principle we will examine in the workshop is the concept of body centre. Through experiencing the relations between our core to other body parts, we will ignite our existing connections within the body and explore how we can use it to transfer movement and power in the body and into space.  
  
  Themes that will be explored in the workshop, among others are:
  -	Concept of centre/ core  
  -	Body structure  
  -	Body connections  
  -	Momentum  
  -	Transfer of movement and power  
  -	Kung Fu way of practice (duration work)  
  -	Partner work
