  Would you like to experience your voice and soundscapes, dive into an inner journey, and learn to integrate it in your dance and performance making?   
  This weekend journey is designed to explore the body as a gate through different tools, as individual as well as in a group, and  to find your own dancing voice, composing and making in real time.  
  This Laboratory is based on my personal ongoing research on the body as a moving sound system, that I’m exploring for the past few years, working with groups, directing pieces based on improvisation and instant composition, with live music, and the human voice, integrated with shamanic tools to unblock the lock, and learn to listen to what is unfolding in the present moment.  

  How to find the voice of your improvising body?  
  How do we embody sound and musicality?  
  How do we use our breath and develop it into sound textures, and language?  

  This questions will be used as guide lines and as tools to help to evolve and develop skills of sensitivity of listening to ourselves, the group and to the space, embodying the voice of the dancing body. This way we can learn to trust and navigate through the material we are making, and listen to the material as its being done, as a musician that listens to his music by making it in the present moment, going to the unknown, and finding new ways of opening to new ways of making and being, and finding joy and freedom. 
  My work is inspired from the practice of Improvisation and composition of dance, sound and voice, as well as breath and singing practises.  
  Working many years as a dancer and performer, and combining it with sound and voice inspired from shamanic work of trance and channeling, I developed tools that are inviting everyone to deepen into an inner journey, and research through the many Archetype's that exists within everyone of us.  
  This tools are helping to develop deep listening to what wants to unfold through us and in the group in the present moment, learning to trust the NOW.  

  This Workshop is open for EVERYONE who:  
  Has interested to get to know the improvisation and real time composition practice, as well as to explore and deepen the research on the human voice in connection to movement, expanding possibilities and exploring the textures and sonic landscapes as an inner journey, as well as in a performance context.
