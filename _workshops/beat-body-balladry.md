  Would you like to dive into an intensive weekend of improvisation and composition with a group?  
  Would you like to experience your voice and language and learn to integrate it in your dance and performance making?   
  So this two days of intensive laboratory is for  you.  
  This Laboratory is based on my personal ongoing research on the body as a moving sound system, that I’m exploring for the past years, working with groups and directing pieces based on improvisation and instant composition, with live music, and the human voice.   
  In this 2 day intensive Laboratory, we will dive in improvisation and compositional skills, focusing on the body as a moving sound system.  

  What is the voice of the improvising body?  
  How do we embody sound?    
  How do we embody musicality?  
  How do we track sound?  
  How do we use our breath and develop it into sound textures, and language?  

  This questions will be used as guide lines and as tools to help to evolve and stimulate critical thinking skills of the mind of the dancing body, and the voice of the dancing body, so to learn to navigate through the material we are making, and listen to the material as its being done, as a musician that listens to his music by making it in the present moment, going to the unknown, and finding new ways of moving and creating a performance.  

  For who is this laboratory?  
  This laboratory is for everyone who is interested to explore and deepen the research on the sounding body in a performance context.
