  Workshop with Anselmo Luisi and Lidia Marinaro!  
  

  The aim of the workshop is to learn basic skills of body language through dance and rhythm.  

  A dancing body can also be a musical body; thanks to body percussion technique and dance improvisation (DanceAbility) in this workshop we will explore and push individual limits beyond the possibilities we normally think our body would have.

  We want to create a common space for artistic expression where each person's diversity is emphasised: limit is the essential starting point of creative action.

  The workshop is open to everyone, also for people with physical or cognitive disability. Dancers and musicians, or people who are just interested in exploring body language: everyone is welcome!  

  Focus of the workshop:  
  In the first steps we will approach the basic body percussion and dance skills separately. On one hand we will explore the wide range of sounds a body can create: we will then learn some simple grooves through coordination exercises and we will perform simple improvisations, both collective and individual.  

  On the other hand we want to explore the relation between body and space while dancing: we want to awaken intuitive thought and discover the pleasure of moving our body at our own pace. How do I relate to different forms and bodies? How can I open up my imagination if I change my point of view? These are some of the questions which will move our workshop.

  After these first steps we will begin blending the two disciplines: dance and music become one same thing, movement generates sound, sound generates movement.

  We will become moving musical bodies: by exploring the possibilities of this new way of living the surrounding space we will be able to create a final collective performance.
