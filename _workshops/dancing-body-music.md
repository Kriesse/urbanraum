  A dancing body can also be a musical body: by combining body percussion and dance improvisation (DanceAbility) we will explore the infinite possibilities of movement and expression beyond the limits we think to have. Limit is the essential condition for our creative process.
  The workshop is open to everybody, also for people with physical or cognitive disability. Musicians, dancers, curious people: everyone is welcome!
