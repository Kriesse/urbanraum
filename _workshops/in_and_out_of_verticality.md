  The teaching offers a research laboratory which deeply focuses on “body weight shift - in and out of verticality”.

  It is presented in 3 phases:    

  - training the body / working with the body, we will bring attention and awareness to the bone structure, its natural alignment and articulations  

  -	exploration, observing and perceiving while the movements are generated. Transferring the weight creates an ongoing motion, an ongoing transition in which being into a vertical axis and being out of it is constantly alternating  

  -	composition, a change of awareness by bringing the exploration into taking a decision, selecting, proposing movements. Finding the connection and transition between them, together.  

  We consider the work as an opportunity for observing, feeling, experiencing, exchanging, confronting and dancing with joy.
