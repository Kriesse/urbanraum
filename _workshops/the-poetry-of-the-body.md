  Dear beings, We are very happy to announce that, finally, the third part of our Workshop -The Poetry of the Body- arrived! We will dive deeper and further into the work we have been developing.
  With new material, excercises, musicians and inspiring journeys. With new fesh air, and a stronger focus into Solo work, musicality, presence and group compositions. We will dance and create POETRY IN MOVEMENT.
  
  The Workshop is- Open for everyone!- even if you didnt attend previous WS you are very welcome to join.  

  With live music! And a no-fear atmosphere!  

  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  
  In this workshop we will explore how to dedicate ourselves entirely and uniquely to the present moment. Keeping ourselves engaged, interested and fascinated by our inner landscapes in a dance of becoming and disappearing. We will compose poems and short pieces using simple and joyful tasks of improvisation alone, in couples or groups. Learning how to listen to yourself and the others, flexibilize your thinking and follow your creative source and expression.  
  
  We will study how to:

  - Create material when there is nothing else there (others / objects)  
  - Connect to our inner stream of energy and expression (follow the inner guide)  
  - Dance tuning in our senses and feelings  
  - Practice commitment to what is happening and is already there, validating our experience  
  - Follow without judgement  
  - Unleash our potential  
  - Put attention in what is already happening and not in what should/could happen, but didn’t.  
  - Unveil your Enthusiasm and Joy  
  - Convert the inner critic into our ally  

  In this 6 hour workshop we will dive deeper in order to set ourselves free from the dictatorship of the inner critic, the logical thinking and the literal meaning; Discovering the symbolic and poetic language we all have.

  You’ll learn to:  
  trust and follow yourself wherever you go,  
  lose control,  
  follow the course of the wild,  
  make the thinking more flexible,  
  increase positive thinking and feeling,  
  amplify possibilities of being and existing in the world.  

  Bring comfortable clothing and a notebook.
