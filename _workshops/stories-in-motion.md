 STORIES IN MOTION /  
 an exploration  
 of memory  
 and imagination  
 through dance


  FOCUS / HOME  
  As a way to hone in on a particular strand of ‘stories in motion’, this workshop will be centred around the concept of home. 
  Inspired both by the abstract idea of rootedness and the practical ways to express this in the body, we will explore what it is to build, to maintain and to move house. Through movement improvisation, speech and play, we will search for the stories of home that connect us to ourselves and to each other.  

  METHOD / VOICE RECORDINGS  
  As a means to unlock interesting material, we will use voice recorders (on smartphones or tablets) to record our stories. 
  Narrated on the day, these recordings will act as tools to listen to other voices and interpret them in movement with intention and clarity.  

  What stories emerge from  
  remembering, reinventing,  
  performing and sharing?


  Together we will /

  - Unravel interpretations of the place in question: Home  
  - Express sentiments and thought processes through the body and movement  
  - Follow our impulses  
  - Use improvisation to delve into deep and rich territory  
  - Find links with other movers and build creative relationships  
  - Enjoy the journey of discovery  

  *‘The home should be the treasure chest of living.’*  
  Le Corbusier
