  STORIES IN MOTION /  
  an exploration  
  of memory  
  and imagination  
  through dance  

  In this workshop we will experiment with a narrative approach to creating movement. Inspired by artist Janet Cardiff’s audio walks and by sociologist Doreen Massey’s understanding of space, we will use place as a trigger for creative expression. Through a series of improvisational tasks, we will build from memory and reconfigure into imagination the locations of our stories. With curiosity and with each other, we will continue our journeys and follow the playful routes they take us on. 
  
  What stories emerge from   
  remembering, reinventing,  
  performing and sharing?

  Together we will /  

  - Express sentiments and thought processes through the body and movement  
  - Follow our impulses  
  - Use improvisation to delve into deep and rich territory  
  - Find links with other movers and build creative relationships  
  - Unravel interpretations of stable and labile places  
  - Enjoy the journey of discovery  
  
    
    
  Beatrix Joyce is a performance artist and dance writer based in Berlin. 
  She trained in contemporary dance at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London and furthered her movement practice with yoga and capoeira. 
  In the search for new sources of inspiration for her artistic work, she undertook an MA in Critical & Creative Analysis across the departments of Sociology, Music and English Literature at Goldsmiths University, London. For her dissertation she invented an empirical research method informed by her background in performance. She is interested in bringing theory into practice and using performance and improvisation as a means to connect, share and discover.

  ‘I try to echo the way our brain shifts attention. Like the way you overhear something that makes you remember something else, or how when you’re out walking you invent scenarios around the things you see. Or the way we’ve become conduits for all these media images, which we’re unable to filter from our memories.’ - Janet Cardiff
