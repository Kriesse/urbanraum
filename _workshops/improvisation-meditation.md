description_en: |  
These sessions offer a holistic body mind training where to touch our inherent creativity through the practice of improvisation in movement and the support of meditation. 
It is a laboratory that invites you to question, explore and communicate from an authentic place. The dynamics that arise from these explorations inform us of the decisions that we are taking constantly and how they affect the way we relate to ourselves, others and our environment.
This work combine formal sitting meditation (stillness) with improvisation in a structured setting (movement), at a personal and collective level. The exercises allow our imagination to arise in the context of body-mind relationship and from that place, we can fully embody the expression of the present moment and begin to move our true dance.
