  Improvisational tools and games give dancers the means to tap into undiscovered possibilities within the body. Allowing the mind to enter a "dream" like state of mind; movement can pass through without inhibitions and habits blocking the path. 
  Rosanna Gamson, an award winning and critically acclaimed choreographer based in Los Angeles, teaches her improvisational game system in a 2 day workshop hosted at URBANRAUM. 
  The system develops dancersâ€™ dynamic range, musicality, interpretive skills and ability to enter deeply into choreography as an interpretive artist, and gives choreographers a new toolkit for movement invention and new compositional strategies. 
  The workshop offers a rigorous yet constructive investigation of your physicality and your imagination.
