  Do you also feel sometimes…  
  ...restricted in your body expressions?...somehow disconnected to your body? Maybe even tense?  
  Or maybe you are just interested in how to move with more pleasure, engaging all your senses and discover how to gain more consciousness about your body.
  This workshop is for everyone, total beginners, as well as experienced movers who feel the urge to find a deeper connection to ones Self and the longing for using your body to express.
  In this Workshop I will use somatic approaches, guided Improvisation and body work to…
  create a room in which you can make the experience of deeply sensing your whole body, raise your body perception and widen your consciousness. It will allow you to be in the moment, totally present in your body. To be present will allow you to be in good contact with your Self and open up new states of being and feeling, which can be astonishingly freeing. 
  It will increase your pleasure in moving and expressing yourself without the fear of doing something wrong. That’s where the magic can happen!
  The understanding of our anatomical body will help us in the first half of the workshop to open up our possibilities to move and to arrive in our bodies before we go into more sensual, intuitive and meditative movement.
