  Do you also feel sometimes...  

  -..restricted in your body expressions?...somehow disconnected to your body? Maybe even tense?  
  Is it difficult for you to take the room, you would actually need to feel good? Or maybe you are just interested in how to move with more pleasure and discover how to gain more consciousness about your body.....
  If you can relate to one of these points, you are right here!  

  This is a workshop for total beginners, as well as for more experienced movers who feel the urge to go deeper into listening and more authentic movement.  

  In this Workshop I will use somatic approaches, guided Improvisation and body work to ...  

  create a room in which you can make the experience of deeply sensing your whole body, raise your body perception and widen your consciousness. It will allow you to be in the moment, totally present in your body! To be present will allow you to be in good contact with yourself and open up new states of being and feeling, which can be quiet freeing. 
  It will increase your pleasure in moving and expressing yourself without the fear of doing something wrong.
  The understanding of our anatomical body will help us in the first half of the workshop to open up our possibilities to move and to arrive in our bodies before we go into more sensual, intuitive and meditative movement.
  So come and allow yourself to be you!   


  No former experience needed! We don't study choreographies!    

  Helin Pachali graduated in March 2017 at the Tanztherapiezentrum Berlin to become a facilitator for dance and healing sessions and is now since 4 years dedicated to the exploration of movement, somatic approaches, emotions, expression, contemporary Improvisation and “Performed Improvisation”. A special affair to her heart is to show other people their way into their body and through that into joy.
