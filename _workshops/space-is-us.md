  Space – as perception, as attentiveness  

  In the workshop we will research the subtle and elusive state of creating a common space with another person. A space that is neither the space that is inside my own body, nor the space that is around me, but rather dissolving the hierarchy between out and in.  

  We will start with individual work – finding a physical structure that works with gravity and establishing connections in the body. We will then go into partner work, inspired by Chinese martial arts, leading and being led, developing our listning with a partner, while both sides stay centered.  

  About Kung Fu Dance:  
  In Kung Fu Dance we explore movement principles and elements drawn from internal Chinese martial arts. Through these principles, we can deepen our understanding of the kinesthetic body which further increase our awareness of movement possibilities and leads us into creative movement and dance.
