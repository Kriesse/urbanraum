 The workshop is aimed at anyone interested in partnering to improvise, create and expand movement vocabulary and choreographically compose through contact with others. 
 We will focus on the work with touch as a movement generator by going through different layers of it: recognizing at first the contact potential through a first warm-up section.  
 Then, entering into a constant dynamic of giving and receiving, we develop an attentive listening with a partner. From this point on, we begin to deal with different intensities, qualities and tones of touch allowing this information to resonate through the body.  
 We will then focus on what we can feel, perceive and visualize within the work of touch transcribing it into movement material. At the same time we will place this work in space and time and work here with the paths and tissues that we form and produce as we move in pairs. The exploration of dynamics, including acceleration, deceleration, silence, among others, is also part of this section. Beyond choreographic composition, we build on the possibility of practicing dialogue, communication and creation through the potential universe of touch and movement.

  JENNY OCAMPO is a choreographer, dancer, dance teacher and mentor based in Berlin. She was born in Colombia and moved to Germany, where she received her dance degree from the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen. She is currently completing Dance Science at the Freie Universität in Berlin (M.A.). She worked for several years as a solo dancer for the Dance Theatre Company at Theater Münster and was chosen by Pina Bausch to dance Le Sacre du Printemps and Tannhäuser. Since 2009 she has been working as a freelance dancer and, in addition to her work with Hidden Tracks, is realizing her own projects in collaboration with other artists* and theatres of the independent scene in Germany and South America. The works Mirage (2016), Damp Sheets (2017), The Canvas (2017) and S (2018), which premiered in Berlin, are among them.
  She understands choreography as a natural process in which everything takes its own and natural development, which is a kind of instability and unfolding of the extraordinary character of human actions and emotions. Her method, based on improvisation, links the perception of the inner and outer world to dance and performance.
