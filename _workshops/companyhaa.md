  This improvisation based workshop offers a space to explore the multi-faceted awareness of a dancer/ performer in a holistic, playful manner. A physical warm-up leads us into an exploration of movement qualities, dynamics, interaction and listening through individual research, group work and partnering. The work invites us to inhabit and to challenge our personal, authentic qualities, gradually building towards instant composition, little “stories” in space, which we will participate and observe. All these tasks serve as instruments to reach a certain field where our personal presence, with its own specific language, is engaged and allowed to express itself.

  Open for all levels.  

  COMPANY HAA is a collaboration of four dance artists from different countries, based in Berlin, Germany. Having found each other and worked together for several years through Collective ONE:THIRD, we share an interest in combining different forms of art into a work that reflects humanity and communicates in a transparent manner. Coming from different backgrounds, our meeting point lies in improvisation and instant composition, in which we cultivate our individual qualities, complex physicality and performative elements. In the desire of opening up our vocabulary, involving new media and other artists, we decided to form Company HAA, a platform for any dance related art. Our work intends to challenge the traditional idea of a performative space. Each of us is continuously developing the research in their personal ways and by coming together we complement each other in a unique manner.
