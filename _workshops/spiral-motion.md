  We will explore movement principles and elements drawn from internal Chinese martial arts. Through these principles, we can deepen our understanding of the kinesthetic body which further increase our awareness of movement possibilities and leads us into creative movement and dance.  
 
  Spiral motion:  
  One of the most fascinating movement principle within the Chinese martial arts, is the spiral. The deeper one dives into this art, the presence of spirals becomes more apparent throughout the forms and techniques, including the seeming “still postures”. In this workshop, we will explore the essence of the spiral, in relation to the center of the body and experience the continuous quality of the spiral, unfolding a physical feeling of infinite continuous flow.  
 
  The workshop will consist two main parts: the first part will focus on instructed movements and exercises inspired by internal martial arts. The second part will take the principles into guided improvisation, providing a platform for individual research and exploration.  
 
  Themes that will be explored in the workshop, among others are:  
  - Concept of center/core  
  - Body structure  
  - Body connections    
  - Spiral movement  
  - Momentum  
  - Transfer of movement and power  
  - Partner work
