  Experiencing connectedness, aliveness and presence  
  Embracing intuition and imagination  
  Dancing with effortlessness, freedom and articulation  


  Skinner Releasing Technique™ (SRT) is a dance and movement training for all those with an interest in engaging the whole self in the dynamic dialogue between imagination and movement. Developed by American dance artist Joan Skinner this integrative dance practice is unique in the way it enhances technical growth and creative process.
  SRT stimulates the process of letting go of one’s tensions and holding patterns, and through that, releases new possibilities in how we perceive and how we dance. Guided poetic imagery and hands- on partner studies facilitate a deeper kinaesthetic experience of movement and a sense of wholeness.
  Practicing the different releasing principles individually, with a partner or a group provides the experience of dynamic and multi-dimensional alignment; one gains strength and flexibility and finds more freedom, effortlessness and presence in movement.  

  These 5 morning classes are designed to progressively offer insights into the basic principles of SRT. Participating in the entire series allows you to deepen and refine your experience and process. However, you are also welcome to participate in single classes.  

  The classes are open to advanced movers, professional dancers, teachers, somatic practitioners and anybody else with an interest in movement and dance. 
  
  Bettina Neuhaus is an Amsterdam-based dance artist and certified Skinner Releasing (SRT) teacher at both Introductory and Ongoing levels. She studied contemporary dance at the Theaterschool Amsterdam und holds a Masters in Creative Practice Dance from Independent Dance and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. Her choreographic and performative work centers around Instant Composition including collaborations with musicians, visual artists, poets and philosophers. Bettina teaches SRT and Instant Composition extensively at major academies, festivals and studios across Europe and South America.

  "My practice and work as dance artist, researcher and teacher are propelled by my ongoing fascination of the dancing body with its inherent imagination and intelligence, its poetry and musicality and its infinite possibilities of transformation and expression through which we connect to the world."
