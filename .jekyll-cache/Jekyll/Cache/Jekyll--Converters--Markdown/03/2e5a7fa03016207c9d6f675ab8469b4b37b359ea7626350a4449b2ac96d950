<p>Poetry in motion.<br />
The body takes us into journeys. Together or alone.<br />
Considering dance and movement as verses from a poem.<br />
Using movement as expressive tool.<br />
Letting the body be the guide.<br />
Art and dance.</p>

<p>ABOUT THE CLASS:</p>

<p>Experiencing different improvisation techniques, we will work intensively with the body and its ocean of expression, allowing the poetics of the body and its presence in motion to unfold; going a bit further on taking that into Compositions. Creating short pieces and ‚Äúpoems in movement‚Äù that are open to meaning and interpretation. Unfolding suggestive landscapes and alive compositions.</p>

<p>We will work with presence, inner visions, and imagination, inner discourse/speech, decision-making, braveness, vulnerability, clarity of movement, musicality and present time awareness. Using tasks and exercises related to practices like Action Theatre, Instant Composition, Dance Improvisation, Creative Writing, and Butoh.</p>

<p>The class will begin with a research practice where we will explore the possibilities of movement and dynamics, expanding our movement vocabulary, visiting thought improvisation different qualities and choices; in order to make ourselves available and potentially free in HOW we move. Here we will work on expanding, rediscovering and experiencing the HOW and WHAT we are doing. Creating our own material and acknowledging it as a dynamic constantly changing living thing, that has its own life, detached from our identity.</p>

<p>We will work a lot on learning how to LISTEN to ourselves and others. We will practice being constantly in present time, ready and available, like a wildcat. Creating and choreographing, phrasing the movement in order to let the material speak up and dance it with joy.</p>

<p>Taking that a bit further we will jump into the field of relation to others, to ourselves, and to the material we are creating, or that‚Äôs being created. Working on duos, trios, and group compositions as well as in Solos. Taking the whole work to serve the composition, and letting it rip off you to serve the poetry and the ‚Äúthird body‚Äù = The composition. Practicing WHERE and WHEN we do what we do, and noticing how time and space can be modified.</p>

<p>The class is also conceived as a PERFORMANCE PROJECT. Around May-June, participants of the class, under the direction and guidance of the teacher, will perform a piece that will be created on these sessions and on possibly, extended hours of rehearsals.</p>

<p>Last year we created and performed the piece ‚ÄúWe Ghosts‚Äù, dance improvisation and composition 40 min piece that was shown for two nights at Urbanraum, under a weekend performance event. The participants that took part in it still remain in this group, and we are heading further this year.</p>

<p>///</p>

<p>This class is offered to those with experience in Dance and Improvisation (Intermediate as well as advanced).
There is already a regular group coming to the sessions, formed by the last year The Poetic Body students and other experienced participants. If you are willing to join us, please feel welcome to send an email with a little description of your dance/movement experience.</p>

<p><em>Like a baby who has not yet learned to smile</em><br />
<em>but attempts everything innocently,</em><br />
<em>the baby has no past to measure the present.</em></p>

<p><em>Go beyond the idea of right and wrong</em><br />
<em>Never forget that you are a child of nature.</em></p>

<p><em>Because every day is new,</em><br />
<em>you have never arrived</em><br />
<em>and cannot expect to understand.</em><br />
<em>So let it go.</em></p>

<p><em>Be gracious in times of confusion</em><br />
<em>because the Way is mysterious</em></p>

<p><em>Your thoughts ever manifest as experience.</em><br />
<em>Become the master of your response.</em></p>
