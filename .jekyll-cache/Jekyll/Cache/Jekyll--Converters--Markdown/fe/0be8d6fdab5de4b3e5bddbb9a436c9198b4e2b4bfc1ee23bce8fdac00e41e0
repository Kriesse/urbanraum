I"ô<p>Currently Iâ€™m based in Berlin and working on several projects as dancer and choreographer, beside my commitment as dance teacher, Iâ€™m also teaching GYROKINESISÂ® method.<br />
In 1993 I graduated in Ballet and Modern dance in Italy. Till 2002 I kept increasing my knowledge with teachers such as D. Zambrano, I. Wolfe, C. Carlson and S. Linke.<br />
In 2004 I was involved in the new production â€œMacht das Was?â€ created by Susanne Linke for Versiliadanza company. From 2005 to 2007 I took part of the evening Solos choreographed by us, as companyâ€™s dancers, and coached by S. Linke.<br />
I worked in several dance companies, but since 1999 Iâ€™ve been involved as dancer, choreographer and now as guest in the â€œBorderLine Danzaâ€ contemporary dance company.<br />
Starting from 2006 Iâ€™ve been collaborating with Luca Canciello (musician and composer) creating â€œStepstunedâ€, a project focused on the research of interaction between noise/sound and movement.</p>

<p>I also worked and working at Deutsche Oper and Staatsoper Im Schiller Theater for several projects. Next to my dance activity as choreographer and dancer, I constantly teach contemporary technique, composition and improvissation. Since 2013 Iâ€™ve been working with S. Linke as assistant and interpreter during her workshops across Europe. With my projects, coached by her, I performed in several Festivals(100grad Berlin,Tanznacht Berlin, Die Lange Nacht der Opern und Theater, 638 Kilo Tanz Festival ).
Since April 2015 Iâ€™ve been involved, together with other colleagues, in the â€œInner Suspensionâ€ project, which is the S. Linkeâ€™s technique. 
This education-project will give me the possibility to get a certification and be authorized to teach the Inner Suspension technique.</p>
