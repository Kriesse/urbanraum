<p>We are exited to start a new season of ongoing classes, taught by an international teachers team that share the AS as their common lense to investigate and transmit dance and movement. In addition each teacher brings a diverse backround which allows to enter shared information from different viewpoints and offers various movement emphasis. This provides a continuous and connective yet dynamic training approach.</p>

<p>The Axis Syllabus is a constantly evolving reference system, or lexicon for the organization and cross-correlation of empirical and scientific findings from the study of human movement. This includes anatomical details, physics, practical applications, research, analysis and transmission. An Axis Syllabus class aims to create a collaborative learning environment and effective space for personal research.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing drop-in training and all levels are welcome, however if you are a beginner in dance and movement we recommend to be able to commit to a longer period.</p>
