I"<p>MIRAR_ Performance Projekt in OPEN SPACE takes place in Urbanraum and in the square of Hermannplatz in Berlin.<br />
MIRAR means in Spanish to look. MIRAR is a performance project in the form of a laboratory that reflects on the human condition of loneliness in contemporary society. Working in a dance studio and later in the public space, we will generate minimal performative actions that interfere in the personal space of the passerby.<br />
The laboratory aims to provide tools to expand the internal and external perception (Socio-cultural-geographical-perception): What happens in my social/geographic context? Where and with whom I am? With whom do I co-exist?<br />
We will take the public space as a place of encounter with the other and as a natural setting for performative actions. Working on improvisation and somatic principles (with somatic methods), a situational choreography will be developed to be presented at the end of the Workshop.</p>

<p>(Situational choreography means: a choreography that is permeable to a specific social context and reacts to a spontaneous public.)</p>

<p>The methodology of working will be in 4 Steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initiating with the self-exploration, listening to the own movement, developing the own creativity.</li>
  <li>Working in close interaction with the participants of the workshop: improvisation exercises with eyes contact and body-work to develop a group feeling.</li>
  <li>Afterwards,  this perception and interaction will expand towards open and public space, inhabiting spaces as scenarios. We will construct images of the body in space, composing with the single body and its position in it.</li>
  <li>The last step will be the action of looking in the open space, through the method of participating observation. We will observe, listen and write; echoing sensitive experiences into the body and then constructing performative actions that seek closeness with people.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aimed at: artists, creators, performers, dancers, actors, directors and to all people with all kind of bodies with an interest in the performance and its expansion in the public space. No knowledge in performance or dance is needed.</p>

<p>Limited to: 15 participants.
The LAB will be lead in German and/or English depending on the participators.</p>
