I"&<p>Jagna Anderson lives and works as a multidisciplinary artist and curator in Berlin.<br />
Andersonâ€™s artistic practice extends the concept of choreography/ composition to the instigation of open, collective and generative processes in urban space. Physical experience, which modulates knowledge, communication and interaction at the interfaces of sonics and semantics, aesthetics and politics, is an indispensable part of these processes.<br />
Anderson is part of art collectives: p.u.re. - performative urban research ensemble, WAH (dance, experimental music, digital arts), GANG (dance), Dona Jagdi (vocal composing / performance). Together with Dodi Helschinger, she has been directing since 2015 impro.per.arts, a platform for non-disciplinary real-time art.<br />
