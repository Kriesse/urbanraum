  Due to the current lockdown URBANRAUM is currently closed again. Since we just had a 3-fold rent increase in August, we have to fight very hard. Stay faithful to your classes in URBANRAUM and support the teachers who have been teaching there for many years.  
  And feel free to recommend the space to others - it can be used for professional rehearsals, photo shootings, therapy groups etc.(i.e. everything that is currently allowed) can be rented in compliance with the hygiene conditions.  
  Stay healthy,  
  Frieda
