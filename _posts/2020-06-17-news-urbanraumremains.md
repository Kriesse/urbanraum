URBANRAUM remains for another 5 years!  
  Many of you have noticed that the URBANRAUM was threatened by a massive rent increase. Thanks to the fantastic support of KIEZGEWERBE UG, constructive negotiations with the landlord of the URBANRAUM took place and in the end an agreement was reached. We will stay for another 5 years!  
  Nevertheless, the rent will increase three times - and the URBANRAUM is very happy that the association ACT e.V. Führe Regie über dein Leben, with which we have been connected for a long time, will join us as a cooperation partner. You can read more about the great work of Act e.V. here: www.act-berlin.de

  More information about our cooperation will follow soon!

  Thank you for all your support over the last months!  
  It helped a lot to know that so many people are behind the URBANRAUM and that it is worthwhile to fight for this place!
